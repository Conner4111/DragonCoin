# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security issues send an email to disclosure@navio.org (not for support).

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name | Fingerprint |
|------|-------------|
| Navio Disclosure | EF18 5DD3 91B9 1FAB BD19  1B7B CB17 7C13 FC14 C3B8 |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individualâ€™s fingerprint: `gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints containing spaces.
